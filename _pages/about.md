Welcome to my academic homepage!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Dalian University of Technology and an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Mathematics, Polish Academy of Sciences.  
My research focuses on topological dynamics and ergodic theory. I am also exploring topics in probability theory and C*-algebras.

My work has been published in journals such as *Advances in Mathematics*, *Annals of Applied Probability*, *Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems*, and the *Journal of Differential Equations*.
