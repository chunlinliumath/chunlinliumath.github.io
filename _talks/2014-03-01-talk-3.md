The talk will begin by providing a brief review of entropy, preimage entropy, and metric mean dimension from both the measure-theoretic and topological perspectives. Then, we will introduce the preimage metric mean dimension, which is introduced for studying systems with infinite preimage entropy. Specifically, we will prove a partial variational principle and compute the preimage mean metric dimension for a series of examples. Based on joint work with Fagner B. Rodrigues.
